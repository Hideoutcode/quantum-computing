Qubits need to be controlled and measured using microwave pulses and readout resonators.


Each qubit is connected to a readout resonator.
A microwave pulse excites the resonator, and the frequency shift is used to determine the qubitâ€™s state.
Classical electronics are used to generate control pulses and readout signals.
