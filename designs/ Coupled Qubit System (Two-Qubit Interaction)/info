Qubits need to interact to perform quantum logic operations. This is done by coupling two transmon qubits using a t
unable coupler (another Josephson junction or resonator).


The coupler allows the qubits to exchange information.
By adjusting the frequency of the coupler, we can turn interactions on or off, enabling quantum gates.
This is used for CNOT gates and entanglement generation.
