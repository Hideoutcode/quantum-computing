A transmon qubit is one of the most widely used superconducting qubits. It consists of a Josephson junction, 
capacitor, and superconducting loop to create a nonlinear quantum circuit.


The Josephson junction provides nonlinearity, allowing for well-defined energy levels.
The capacitance acts as a shunt to reduce charge noise, increasing coherence times.
The qubit frequency is controlled by E_J (Josephson energy) and E_C (charging energy).
