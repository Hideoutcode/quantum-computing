A scalable quantum processor is built using a 2D grid of qubits, each connected via resonators or couplers.


Q1, Q2, Q3, etc. = Transmon Qubits

C1, C2, etc. = Couplers (Tunable Resonators)

X = Cross-resonance points for multi-qubit interactions

This design ensures modular scalability and efficient qubit interactions.
